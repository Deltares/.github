[Deltares](https://deltares.nl/en) is an independent institute for applied research in the field of water and subsurface. Throughout the world, we work on smart solutions, innovations and applications for people, environment and society.

From the perspective of water, the subsurface and infrastructure, we will be working on four Mission Areas in which we set out our contributions to the international and Dutch agendas and tasks: 
- Future deltas
- Sustainable deltas
- Safe deltas
- Resilient infrastructure.

Managing densely populated and vulnerable areas is complex, which is why we work closely with governments, businesses, other research institutes, universities and NGOâ€™s at home and abroad.
